Fake Prank Virus - Team Hydra
Description: Fake virus(kind of) with a main purpose of tricking somebody into thinking they have just acquired a free botnet. Instead it blocks the user from closing the command prompt that then launches shell executions which involve opening hidden google chrome tabs of a song whilst forcing the user to listen to the song due to the coding involved which freezes the users cursor at (0,0) whilst also forcing the users Master Volume to be at 100 and prevents users from pressing the mute button. Not to mention that the taskbar is also disabled and hidden until computer is restarted.

Only way to exit application is to do CTRL + ALT + DEL and kill the process via Task Manager.
